Crunchyroll Subtitles
=====================
## What?
This is a chrome extension for adding unsupported subtitles to the Crunchyroll HTML5 player. 

## Why?
Many people have suggested adding Japanese subtitles to videos, but CR's stance on this has been a firm "No." As such, I have decided to try my hand at writing a chrome extension for it.
This is my first extension. I am using this to learn more about developing. there will be bugs, and the code may become disorganized.
